<h3 class="center">About project</h3>
<p>This is a service to create, share, view and like pictures generated based on mathematical sets. This project
  demonstrates how mathematical functions can generate complex and visually stunning patterns.</p>
<p>As an example, the Mandelbrot set is created by iterating the function f(z) = zÂ² + c for complex numbers. Each point
  on the canvas
  is colored based on how quickly the iteration diverges (if at all), creating the intricate patterns characteristic of
  fractals.</p>
<p>The same for other fractals with the difference in used function.</p>
